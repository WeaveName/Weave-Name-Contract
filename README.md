# Weave Name Smart Contracts
Weave Name is a unique naming service based on Layer Zero, created for the entire network. With this name, users and companies can replace computer-generated identifiers, such as wallet addresses, with readable and memorable names. Smart contracts are written using Diamond Proxy (EIP2535), which allow you to further expand the functionality and introduce further innovations as they are not limited in volume and can be changed. They regulate the rules and processes of domain registration, transfer of ownership and resolution of domain rights, providing a reliable basis for functioning. As the latest technologies become available, the project will be constantly updated so that you always stay at the intersection of technologies.  Our goal is to provide a reliable and flexible platform for the exchange of objects in all networks.
